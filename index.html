<p>A little bit about myself I have finished grade 12 have had no other further education as of yet I’ve been to Europe and America both twice, I am avid motorsport fan I will stay up late and watch Formula 1 wherever it is in the world. 
I am born in Australia but have a Dutch family background with the ability to speak some, my mum is first generation born being able to fluidly switch between Dutch and English
My hobbies when I have the time is to go sim racing on my computer and or console and or working on my car I got into it cause driving a real race car does costs a lot of money and sim racing does cost a fraction of the amount that it would cost to set up a real car to go racing with.
