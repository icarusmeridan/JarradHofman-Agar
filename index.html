<h1>dream it job</h1>
<p> 
This job is not necessarily my dream job however it is shouldn’t be a hard job to go for due to the fact that it’s a local job and an shorter commute to get to work.
The job is a network system analyst for Ampol fuels it makes it appealing due to the fact it got good bonuses and its local/fulltime,
It has many employee benefits and to get into the job you need a degree in it, engineering and or business  
I have many skills regarding managing items and programs however I do not have any formal degree which would be required an IT degree would help me get into this position 
</p>

<div class="myintrestinit">
<h1>My intrest in IT</h1>
<p> My interest in IT started during school during a work experience week where I went to a local IT shop for my work experience week many years ago in school, I enjoyed the practical side of it assembling and disassembling computers. 
As of late I’ve developed a partnership with a friend who builds my computers to specifications and getting a percentage of money on top for me doing there build specification, pickup and delivery of the computer, as well as doing all set up work to allow the computer to be fully functional.

I chose RMIT due to the fact all university courses were online, and I can work when I want to at any time of the day or night depending on what is going on since I am a very busy person most days.

<div class="personalinfo">
<h1>Personal Infomation</h1>
<p>A little bit about myself I have finished grade 12 have had no other further education as of yet I’ve been to Europe and America both twice, I am avid motorsport fan I will stay up late and watch Formula 1 wherever it is in the world. 
I am born in Australia but have a Dutch family background with the ability to speak some, my mum is first generation born being able to fluidly switch between Dutch and English
My hobbies when I have the time is to go sim racing on my computer and or console and or working on my car I got into it cause driving a real race car does costs a lot of money and sim racing does cost a fraction of the amount that it would cost to set up a real car to go racing with.

<h1>project idea</h1>
<p>
I want to develop an easy-to-use phone application that can allow the amateur simulation racer to get faster and learn the all the tracks easier by no means I’m saying the support that is pre-existing on discord is bad it’s just not first-time user friendly, 
By creating something that is friendly to the new Simulation racer and informative with setup information and recommended setups can immensely help new racers.
The application will also book 1 on 1 driver training to also support the new driver to allow them to get up to speed quicker.

The motivation behind this project is as a moderator in a online racing league a lot of new people join looking to race in a group and develop friend groups, however not everyone is a natural and people need some support to unlock their full potential.
By developing a application with a easy to use interface that doesn’t scare people away unlike the current websites and paywalls that exist to get into the support there is some efficacy in helping out the new racer.
The market is ever emerging thanks to the world of Coronavirus due to the number of people staying at home getting into sim racing.

The application will function like a training Wikipedia that collates may different data sets together to allow the user to have as much function as one place as possible.
The user interface will also be a basic design as with the colours of the SRO Motorsports Group which is the group that funded kunos simulazioni as the game that runs most racing leagues are funded by the official racing series parented by SRO Motorsports Group.
The application will have a page for tuning details for respective vehicles within the game with having a built-in weather function, this weather function will allow the user to enter in the weather conditions and then the app will respond with a relative delta time that is a aim for with an corner by corner detailed track map to allow you to drive the car the hardest and get the most out of the car.

It will also come with base in another section of the application that the user can adjust accordingly with further information to break away from the games heavy jargon and technical terms also helping the user.
Having the cars characteristics and how to change sensitivities for each individual car as each car is different and they all respond differently to how the setup is changed, as to the realism of the game.
By having these setup helpers in the game, it can make the game more easily accessible for newer players on console and Personal computers, the application will have an accompanying website, so it is accessible on many different platforms to.
It will have a cross platform capability to as to bridge across the different patch notes that exist on different consoles.
Having this racer application being adapted to each individual game platform will mean all data is up to date for relevant cars and tracks, this is regarding the games tire models cause the tire models in the game are extremely finicky to understand, just like understanding the games BOP (balance of performance) which Is just like the real life GT3 counterparts.
Having the application switching between platforms means that the laser scanned track data stays the same and all tire performances staying the same it means the user can have a better experience and just focus on the driving rather then the constant never ending setup of the car which is a never-ending battle in the game.
The application is there to help set up the car for you then help you learn the tracks in the game, so you can focus on the reason that your there and that is to drive and have fun playing the game you spent your money on.

Once you enjoy the racing pace shall come naturally and the application is to be your companion if you need any help on a new track in your desired racing series.

The tools and technologies that will be required to make this application will be a basic HTML website to make to carry the application information as to make it accessible to people on a very wide basis,
To build the application easily on phone I would like to use an www.kintone.com.au to build the application in a user friendly way the app will need folder information regarding all the tracks, tire models and cars  and keeping the user interface clean concise and easy to use it will allow people to use the application effectively.
The skills required are advanced app building techniques to build the application and upload the tire model into the application as well as being able to take the games physics engine into the application be able to work out tire degradation throughout a race distance. 
This would just be an example of the complexity of the application.
If this application is successful, the application will welcome many new racers to the game with the possibility to expand in the future to other online simulation games in the future,
Removing such a steep learning curve as well to help the amateur player and hoping to improve their skill allowing them to be competitive in an extremely fast competitive racing game with some E sport potential in the future.
Solving the problem of the game having a steep learning curve to newer players hopefully allowing them to get closer to the front of the grid and become more competitive
